Saciva is a secure platform addressing networking, housing, and roommate challenges for over 1 million international students in the USA. The goal of this project is to build a clustering model to help international students in the US network, find housing, and connect with roommates without having to use filters.

Over the past few months, we:
✅ Gathered and preprocessed datasets, including climate, cost of living, and university data.
✅ Applied advanced clustering techniques like DBSCAN to organize universities into meaningful groups.
✅ Profiled clusters based on key features such as cost of living, climate, and safety, ensuring personalized solutions.
